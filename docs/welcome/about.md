# About

The New Generation of Devs (NGOD) was born in the middle of my career as a developer when the requirements in my role as a software engineer exceeded my existing knowledge, and I needed to learn new skills.

**How can I learn these skills more quickly using AI? What is the role of AI?**

AI can generate code for me, sometimes lacking best practices, contextual understanding, functional requirements, design patterns, and so on. At the end of the day, AI provides code, basic functions, and code snippets that we can use to build large-scale projects and solve real-life problems.

However, AI cannot connect the code and comprehend the overall workings of the software from a holistic perspective (at least as of May 2023). It doesn't understand the architecture, various client requirements, or why a specific technology is chosen to solve a problem.

**So, what is my job as a software engineer if AI can generate basic code for simple and specific requirements?**

My job is to:

**Understand how build high quality software:**

- Implement patterns
- Follow good practices
- Utilize different technologies
- Evaluate pros, cons, tools, and compatibility of each technology
- Solve complex bugs
- Understand requirements
- Design optimal solutions and consider alternatives
- Connect all features and components in the project
- Manage the development process effectively
- And more

**Conclusion:**

- Learn the fundamentals of building high-quality software.
- Understand the components that constitute high-quality software.
- Familiarize yourself with the tools associated with each technology.
- Specialize in one stack while having knowledge in various software topics.

If I encounter a specific coding requirement that I don't know how to implement step by step, AI can assist me. However, it is crucial that I possess a general understanding of how things work and how all the components fit together in the project.

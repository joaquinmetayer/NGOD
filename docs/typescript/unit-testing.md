# Unit Testing with TS

Unit testing is an important component in software development as it allows verifying that each unit of code (such as functions, methods, or classes) functions correctly in isolation. In TypeScript, there are various tools and frameworks available for performing unit testing. Here are the key concepts related to unit testing in TypeScript.

## Test environment setup
To perform unit testing in TypeScript, it's necessary to set up a suitable testing environment. This includes installing the necessary dependencies, configuring testing execution tools, and structuring the project in a way that tests can be run separately.

## Unit testing frameworks
There are several popular frameworks for unit testing in TypeScript, such as Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, and AVA. These frameworks provide a clear structure and syntax for defining and executing tests, as well as assertion utilities to check expected results.

## Writing and executing unit tests
To write unit tests, assertions are used to verify that the behavior of the unit of code is as expected. This involves setting up conditions and comparing the obtained results with the expected results. Unit testing frameworks provide different methods for making assertions, such as `expect`, `assert`, or `should`.

  Here's a simple example of a unit test in TypeScript using the Jest framework:

  ```typescript
  // Code under test
  function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }

  // Unit test
  test('Sum of two numbers', () => {
    const result = sum(2, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(5);
  });
  ```

  The above test verifies that the `sum` function correctly adds two numbers and that the result is as expected.

By performing unit testing in TypeScript, it's possible to ensure that each unit of code functions correctly in isolation, making it easier to detect errors and improve code quality. Unit testing frameworks provide a structure and tools that simplify the writing and execution of tests, making it easier to incorporate them into the development workflow.

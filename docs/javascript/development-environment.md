# Development Environment

## Installing a modern web browser
To program in JavaScript, you will need a modern web browser installed on your computer. Some popular options include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. These browsers come with built-in development tools that make it easier to write and debug JavaScript code.

## Using the browser console to run code
Most web browsers have a built-in console, which is a tool where you can write and execute JavaScript code. The console provides an interactive environment for quickly testing code snippets, performing tests, and debugging issues. You can open the browser console by pressing the F12 key or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect element."

## Development tools
Development tools like the Chrome Inspector provide a set of functions to help you develop and debug JavaScript applications. These tools allow you to inspect and modify the HTML and CSS of a page, analyze performance, track errors, set breakpoints, and much more. The Chrome Inspector is a popular tool available in the Google Chrome browser and offers a wide range of features for JavaScript development.
